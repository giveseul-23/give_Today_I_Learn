<p>
    <span id="first" class="js">JavaScript</span> (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/[6]), often abbreviated as JS, is a
    high-level, dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based,
    multi-paradigm, and interpreted programming language.
    Alongside HTML and CSS, <span class="js">JavaScript</span> is one of
    the three core technologies of World Wide Web content
    production. It is used to make webpages interactive and
    provide online programs, including video games.
    The majority of websites employ it, and all modern
    web browsers support it without the need for plug-ins
    by means of a built-in <span class="js">JavaScript</span>
    engine. Each of the many JavaScrip
    engines represent a different implementation of
    <span class="js">JavaScript</span>,
    all based on the ECMAScript specification,
    with some engines not supporting the spec fully, and with many engines supporting additional features beyond ECMA.
